# g3nACM project

Small test application to test alternative ways to use Gen AI in AML investigations. In this we are going to try and see if we can have AI agents help users.

In AML investigations a typical challenge is that each bank will want slightly customerised screens where they add ever so slightly different data. This requires very specific applications that are very tricky to upgrade.

A facet of GenAI people tend to overlook is the fact they can render UI. So the question is; If you give a Gen AI/Agent a set of tools to flexibly help an investigator and render dynamic UI, how will that change investigations? It might help render specific UI and with prompting might even be made very end-user specific.
